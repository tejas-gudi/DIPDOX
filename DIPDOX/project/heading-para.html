                ●	Sometimes you will get a 500 Internal Server Error or 504 Gateway Time-out.
                In most cases, this means that Sci-Hub has the paper, 
                but the server is temporarily overloaded. 
                Refreshing the page a few times ought to fix this 
                (you may have to re-enter CAPTCHA’s with every refresh). 
                If it doesn’t work immediately, you can try again a bit later too—it 
                has always worked for me.
